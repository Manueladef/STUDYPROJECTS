# Marche Hospitality Management System
## 📌 Overview
The Marche Hospitality Management System is designed to facilitate the management and analysis of hospitality structures in the Marche region. Utilizing Excel, Power Query, and Power Pivot, the system enables efficient data validation, structured data transformation, and analytical reporting through pivot tables.
## 🎯 Purpose
This project was developed as part of a Data Analyst course to provide hands-on experience in data validation, pivot table analysis, Power Query transformations, and relational data modeling using Power Pivot. The objective is to create a structured and interactive system for analyzing hospitality data effectively.
## 📂 Files Included
1.	W4D5_Esercitazione_Finale_elencostrutture.xlsx <br />
o	Contains the primary dataset of hospitality structures. <br />
o	Includes sheets for data lookup and pivot table analysis. <br />
2.	W4D5_Esercitazione_Finale_MODELLO DATI.xlsx <br />
o	Contains cleaned and transformed data using Power Query. <br />
o	Includes data modeling and relationships in Power Pivot. <br />
3. ElencoStruttureRicettive.xlsx – Raw dataset of hospitality structures <br />
4. prezzimedi.xlsx – Average pricing per city dataset <br />

## ✨Key Features <br />
Data Lookup & Filtering (RICERCA Sheet) <br />
•	A dropdown menu (C3) allows users to select a hospitality structure. <br />
•	Displays details of the selected structure, including city, address, and email. <br />
•	Automatically calculates:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; o	Total number of structures in the region.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; o	Number of structures in the same city as the selected one.<br />
Pivot Table Analysis (PIVOT Sheet)<br />
•	A pivot table aggregates the number of structures by Category.<br />
•	The data can be filtered by City to analyze category distribution across locations.<br />
Data Cleaning & Modeling (MODELLO DATI.xlsx)<br />
•	The Elenco_strutture_ricettive_v2 sheet contains a cleaned version of the dataset:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; o	Removed empty rows and standardized text formatting (capitalization, spacing, etc.).<br />
•	The prezzi sheet contains average pricing per city.<br />
•	Both tables are loaded into Power Pivot and linked by City to enable relational data analysis. <br />
## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used <br />
