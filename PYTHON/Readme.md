# COVID-19 Data Analysis

This directory contains a Jupyter Notebook (`covid_analysis.ipynb`) and supporting files for a data analysis project focused on COVID-19 data.  The project explores global case trends, a detailed look at Italy's data during 2022, and a comparison of ICU and hospitalization data across several European countries.

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes COVID-19 data from the Our World in Data dataset. The analysis covers:

* Global trends in total COVID-19 cases by continent.
* Evolution of total and new COVID-19 cases in Italy during 2022.
* Distribution of days with zero new cases in Italy during 2022.
* Comparison of ICU patient numbers between Italy, Germany, and France.
* Analysis of hospitalization data for Italy, Germany, France, and Spain in 2023.

🛠️ Key Features

✔ Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas <br />
✔ Data manipulation and analysis with Pandas and NumPy <br />
✔ Data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib <br />
✔ Identification and discussion of data quality issues (e.g., missing data) <br />
✔ Clear and concise presentation of findings<br />

📂 Files Included

* `covid_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete data analysis.

🎯 Purpose

This project was developed to demonstrate my data analysis skills, including data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and interpretation.  It showcases my ability to work with real-world datasets and extract meaningful insights.

📈 Key Insights (Summarized)

* Asia and Europe had the highest total COVID-19 case numbers.
* Total cases in Italy generally increased throughout 2022, with fluctuations in new cases.
* ICU patient numbers were lower in Italy compared to France and Germany.
* Hospitalization data for Germany in 2023 was incomplete.
