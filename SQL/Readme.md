This directory contains a SQL database schema and an Entity-Relationship (E-R) model, designed as part of a Data Analysis course project.
The schema models a simple product management system, including categories, products, sales, and geographical distribution.

## 📌 Project Overview
The database ESAMEToysGroup is structured to manage:
•	Products and their categories
•	Sales transactions, including quantity, price, and date
•	Regions and countries for product distribution
•	Relationships between these entities using primary and foreign keys

## 🛠️ Key Features
✔ Normalized relational design for efficient querying
✔ Primary & Foreign Key constraints for data integrity
✔ Entity-Relationship diagram (E-R model) for visualizing database structure

## 📂 Files Included
•	MDF_EsercizioFinale.sql: SQL script to create and structure the database
•	E-R schema.png: Entity-Relationship diagram for database visualization

## 🚀 Getting Started
To set up the database:
1.	Open the SQL script in your preferred DBMS (MySQL, SQL Server, etc.)
2.	Execute the script to create the database and tables

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was developed as a learning exercise in database design, normalization, SQL constraints, and E-R modeling.
